  <h1>Why color is great, espically when it blinds you!</h1>
  
  <h2>Thinking about color</h2>
  <p>If you're reading this, I'm assuming you can see color. I know <i>you</i> probably don't think this website is pretty, but someone who is totally colorblind would love to see this. Remember to not take color for granted!</p>
  
  <h2>Are you color blind?</h2>
  
  <p>If this dress looks white and gold to you, it means you like to go outside ;)<br>
    If you see it as blue and black, you are technically correct, but not because only I'm the only one allowed to be correct.
